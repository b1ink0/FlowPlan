## Plan Panel

The Plan Panel is where you manage your projects and plans. It allows you to:

This panel serves as the entry point to your work in FlowPlan. Select a plan from this panel to load it into the Map Panel for editing.

Key features:

When you create a plan from the Plan Panel or import a Plan, click on the plan name to load that plan into the Map Panel.

## Node Panel

The Node Panel appears when you edit a node and allows you to:
- Modify node titles
- Adjust text formatting
- Customize node appearance
- Configure node settings
- Save node changes

This panel provides detailed control over individual nodes in your plan.

## Document Panel

The Document Panel enables you to add rich content to each node using various field types:
- Headings

- And more

Access this panel by double-clicking on a node's title to add detailed information to your plan.
